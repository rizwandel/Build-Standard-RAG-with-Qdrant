They are responsible for ensuring that their AI systems comply with the Act's requirements, including risk management, transparency, and robustness. 2. Users: These are individuals or organizations that use AI systems but do not develop them. Users have obligations to use AI systems in accordance with the provider's instructions and to report any issues or non-compliance. 3. Distributors/Importers: These entities are responsible for placing AI systems on the market or putting them into service. They must ensure that the AI systems they distribute or import comply with the Act's requirements. 4. Authorized Representatives: These are entities appointed by providers to act on their behalf in relation to the obligations under the Act. 5. Notified Bodies: These are independent organizations designated by national authorities to carry out conformity assessment tasks associated with AI systems. 6.
